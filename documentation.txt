--GoTranind  Project description 
This project is home assignment for Edgegaming company 
It’s an FPS training game to improve accuracy and mouse control.
The level is designed like a shooting range, on each round 5 targets will appear from left to right in a slightly different place to make the aiming more challenging.
When you shoot each target you will see a small number above the target, the number represents the score from 1 to 10 
After each round your total score will be calculated.

In addition there is a sound of bullet hitting the target to indicate the hit 
And a sound effect for pressing the reset button

All the scripts were written by me except those that was imported with “YuME” .

--Training process description
There are two training modes that the player can choose from (by pressing the buttons in the scene)
Five steel targets that appear one by one.
And one moving targets that you have to hit 5 times
After each round you will see your score and you will have the option to restart the round by pressing the restart button 

--More ideas for future improvement of the game
As a future improvement ideas i want to implement the following features.
*Give the player the option to modify mouse sensitivity.
*Give the player the option to modify the field of view.
*Tweak Target count Target size and the speed of the moving Target.
*More training modes like round arena with targets appearing all around the player.
*Implement a training routine where the player has to move and shoot at the same time. To take advantage of the ability of the player to move.
